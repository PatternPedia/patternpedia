    :hasProblem "You want to connect many different devices to an already existing network, but some of them might not support the networks communication technology or protocol."^^xsd:string ;
    :hasContext "A number of devices have to be connected to a network. These might include Constrained Devices or Semi-Constrained Devices that are limited in their processing power and do not support the communication methods of the network. Or these might also include Unconstrained Devices from legacy systems that cannot connect to the network due to outdated technology. A backend server reachable over this network is intended to process data from these devices."^^xsd:string ;
    :hasForce "Connectivity: Devices have to be connected to a network because you want to access their data and functionality regularly. Doing this manually is not an option."^^xsd:string ,
        "Upgradability: Changing or building up a network so that it supports the communication technology required by the device is often not possible. You might not control the network, or the purpose of the network cannot be realized with the deviceâ€™s technology, e.g. you need a long range network but the device only supports short range communication."^^xsd:string ,
        "Effort: Adding communication capabilities that are supported by the network to all device types would mean a high investment in time and resources, or might not be possible at all because of technological limitations."^^xsd:string ,
        "Diversity: Other devices with different communication technology might also have to be connected to the same network and will face the same problem."^^xsd:string ,
        "Device Numbers: Your network can only support a certain amount of simultaneous connections. The number of devices you want to connect exceeds this limit. Extending the network is not an option."^^xsd:string ;

    :hasVariant "Aggregating Device Gateway: Besides translating communication technologies this gateway also aggregates the messages it receives from the devices in some meaningful way. For example, it might average the temperature readings of several devices and send it on once a minute. This is usually done to reduce the number of individual messages which have to be sent to the backend."^^xsd:string ,
        "Local Processing Device Gateway: In addition to translating communication technologies, this gateway also contains some local processing functionality which could mirror or replace functionality located in the backend. For example, it could contain a local RULES ENGINE which decides some actions directly on the gateway. This is usually done to minimize communication with the backend and therefore reduce latency or to insulate from connection loss between gateway and backend."^^xsd:string .

    :hasContext "A wide range of differing messages from devices and other components are received at the backend server. These might include measurements from sensors, errors, a heartbeat, registration information, etc. These messages can arrive regularly or irregularly. There are different kinds of actions that have to be executed depending on the type of the received message, its content, the time it is received, or other factors."^^xsd:string ;
    :hasForce "Flexibility: The actions to trigger might change over time, new actions might be added, old ones removed, or you might want to temporarily test or disable an action. Hard-coding them into some software component would be possible, but is not flexible enough."^^xsd:string ,
        "Data Sources: In some cases, additional data apart from the device message might be needed to decide if a particular action should be taken."^^xsd:string ,
        "Diversity: The type of action to be triggered can vary significantly depending on the circumstances. In some cases, you might want to add an entry into a log file or send an email. In other cases, you might want to route a message to another service for further processing or store it in some kind of database."^^xsd:string ;

Allow users to define rules using a graphical user interface that evaluate the content of incoming messages or metadata about the message against a set of comparators.

During sleep, they are not reachable on their regular communication channels. In some instances, other components might have to contact sleeping device immediately."^^xsd:string ;
    :hasContext "You have a Constrained Device or Semi-Constrained Device that is Lifetime Energy-Limited or Period Energy-Limited and operates in a Low-Power or Normally-Off mode. You have a backend server where the device is registered, i.e. its identity and other metadata is known to the server. From time to time you have a situation where you want to immediately contact the sleeping device. For example, this could be the case if a critical security fix has to be applied, if you need current sensor values or send commands for one-off time critical situations, or if the device has been lost or stolen and you want to use REMOTE LOCK AND WIPE immediately."^^xsd:string ;

This might be the case because it is installed at an easily accessible public location, or a remote and unmonitored location. The device might have functionality that must not be accessed by a thief. It might also contain classified data that has to be kept protected. The data might or might not be encrypted. The device might be retrievable when it is lost or stolen, but it might also vanish forever."^^xsd:string ;
    :hasForce "Long-term Data Security: If the device is irretrievably stolen, an attacker might have ample time to break encryptions if data on the device is encrypted."^^xsd:string ,
        "Fine-grained Control: Depending on the situation, the type of device and the content on the device, different actions might be necessary in the case of loss or theft."^^xsd:string ,
        "Reversibility: A lost or stolen device might eventually be returned, so any actions taken should be reversible if possible."^^xsd:string ,
        "Remote Control: Since the device is no longer physically available, the activation of additional security mechanisms has to work remotely."^^xsd:string ;
    :hasSolution "Make the device a managed device that can receive and execute management operations from the backend server. Allow authorized users to use the backend server to trigger functionality on the device that can delete files, folders, applications or memory areas, revoke or remove permissions, keys, and certificates, or enable additional security feature.

This can be done by using the Authenticator pattern, which relies on cryptographic mechanisms and tokens but requires some processing power. Thus, this may not be applicable everywhere in IoT systems, where very constrained devices may not have enough resources to execute such a mechanism. Besides, tokens used by these mechanisms may be stolen and used on other devices, or devices may be stolen and used from other locations. Denial-of-service attacks might also be a problem.
