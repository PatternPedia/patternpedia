    :hasContext "Many applications are used by small and medium businesses which do not have the required IT skills to host and maintain their own highly available infrastructure. Especially, requirements regarding business resiliency – the ability to recover from an error – and business continuity – the ability to operate during an error – are challenging. Furthermore, there are laws and regulations making businesses liable to archive data and keep it accessible for audits, often over very long periods of time."^^xsd:string ;

Mainly, Static Workload has to be handled, but some Processing Components experience Periodic Workload, Unpredictable Workload, or Continuously Changing Workload. Application components providing the respective processing functionality experiencing varying workload should, therefore, be hosted in an elastic environment. However, these components have to access large amounts of data during their execution making them highly dependent on the availability and the timely access to such data."^^xsd:string ;

    :hasSolution "The Processing Components experiencing varying workloads are hosted in an elastic cloud together with the data accessed during their operation. Processing Components in the elastic cloud are triggered from the static environment through asynchronous messages exchanged via message queues provided by a Message-oriented Middleware. A Data Access Component in the static environment ensures that data required by elastic Processing Components is stored in Storage Offerings The location where this data is stored may then be passed to the elastic Processing Components during their enactment via messages. Data that is not required by the backend functionality may still be stored in Stateful Components hosted in the static data center."^^xsd:string ;

During development, hardware requirements are often uncertain, so hardware resources should be flexible to extend resources if necessary. During the test phase, diverse test systems may be needed to verify the proper functioning of the application on different operating systems or when being accessed using different client software, i.e., different browsers. Large numbers of resources may also be required to perform load tests. During the productive use other factors, such as security and availability may be of greater importance than resource flexibility."^^xsd:string ;
